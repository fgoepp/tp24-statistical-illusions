Welcome traveller, its a freezing night in St. Petersburg and after a long day you pike into a dive bar. You order a drink while all of a sudden the only other person in the room starts talking and suggests a game. Even though you're not a gambler you consider to play. What else would you do with your evening anyways? The game goes as follows: 
You pay a set entry fee to start the game. Afterwards a coin is flipped until heads comes up, as soon as that happens, the game is over and you win a price. Starting at 2€ if the coin lands heads up directly in the first round, with every tails flip the starting value doubles (so winning on the 3rd toss would mean a return of 8€). The questions now are: How much money should you bet at max. to be expected to win more money then you paid as an entry fee? Would you bet more then 20€? More then 100€?

You may see what happens to the expected value, win probability and possible net win on the plots down below. Feel free to play around a little with parameters such as the entry fee, starting value or number of total throws by using the given sliders. Below you will also find some historical and mathematical background information for this statistical Paradox.
Have fun :D
