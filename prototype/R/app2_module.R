        p("The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle that
          challenges our intuition. Traditionally, it involves a game show where
          a contestant must choose one of three doors, behind one of which is a
          car (the prize) and behind the others are goats (non-prizes). After
          the contestant picks a door, the host, Monty Hall, who knows what's
          behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat.
          The contestant is then given the option to switch to the other
          unopened door or stay with their initial choice. Surprisingly,
          switching doors increases the contestant's chances of winning the car
          from 1/3 to 2/3."),
        p("In this variation of the Monty Hall problem, we extend the scenario
          to include a variable number of total doors while still maintaining
          only one car door. This generalization allows us to gain a deeper
          understanding of the underlying probability. By adjusting the number
          of doors, we can see how the advantage of switching grows even more
          pronounced as the number of doors increases.")
