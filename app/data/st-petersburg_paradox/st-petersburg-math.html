As you might have seen from the plot above something fascinating happens when playing the 
St. Petersburg game. In theory one would have to accept literally every single entry fee 
since the expected win rises to infinity. But how is this possible?
<br/><br/>
We have a starting prize \(x = 2\)€ and the probability for winning a specific prize x in 
the n-th toss of \(p(n) = 0.5^n\). The important thing now is that the prize doubles with 
every toss, so the potential prize on the n-th toss is equal to \(w(x, n) = x^n\).
To calculate the expected value we use the formula for the latter which is 
\(E(X) = \sum_n(w(x, n) \cdot p(n))\) 
<br/><br/>
So now we calculate \(E(X) = \sum_n(2^n \cdot 0.5^n) = \sum_n((2 \cdot 0.5)^n) = \sum_n(1^n) 
= \sum_n(1) = n\) Finally, we found that roughly said the magic causing our paradox is just 
adding up ones until we reach infinity. Quite fascinating isn't it?
<br/><br/>
Knowing that you are expected to win an infinite amount of money no matter how high the entry 
fee is, would you now play with an entry fee of 100€? 1000€? 1000000€? Probably not. 
But why not? I mean yes, the chances to win are extremely small from a certain point on but 
doesn't the potential win increase drastically as well to even it out?
<br/><br/>
The explanation for our behaviour is found with a look towards prospect theory by Kahneman and 
Tversky (1979). According to them the objective win might get larger and larger but the 
subjective win doesn't follow proportionally. For a person with absolutely no money becoming a 
millionaire would be a gigantic step that would make an immense difference on that persons life. 
On the other hand, getting another million when you already are a millionaire makes far less of 
a difference.
<br/><br/>
But what happens if we start changing parameters now? Feel free to try it out on your own by 
changing the parameters at the experimental playground below.
